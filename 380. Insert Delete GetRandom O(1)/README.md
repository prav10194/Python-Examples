## Problem Statement

Implement the functions of the class such that each function (insert, remove, getRandom) works in average O(1) time complexity.

The runtime complexity of the set.add(), set.remove() function is O(1) because Python's set data structure is implemented as a hash table and you can expect lookup, insert, and delete operations to have constant runtime complexity.
