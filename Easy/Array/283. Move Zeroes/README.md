Easy

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]

<b>Solution: Keep a pointer for tracking the position of zero value in an array. Update the pointer by one when it sees a non-zero value and swap the values. </b>
